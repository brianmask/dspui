+ Run PlayOnline. On the left side of the screen click **Check Files**
+ On the next screen where it says **"PlayOnlineViewer"** click the two arrows and change it to **"Final Fantasy XI"**. The "version" should be **"UNKNOWN"**
  + **if it does not work then redo Step 3 and carry on following from there**

+ Click on the Check Files button.
+ PlayOnline will then check all the FINAL FANTASY XI files (usually takes about 15-20 minutes) and prompt you on what to do because it found errors.
+ You should then choose to fix the errors. They are errors after all and need to be fixed.
+ PlayOnline will then automatically start checking and updating files.
  + This takes around ~20 minutes with new client install, 5-10hrs with the old. 
  + Once it starts downloading you can leave it unattentended if you wish to do so, it seems to go faster if the window has focus though.

+ Once you're done updating, navigate to /PlayOnlineViewer/.
+ Right-click the "data" folder and click copy
+ Navigate to /FINAL FANTASY XI/, right click an empty space in the folder and click paste. 
  + You should now have the "data" folder inside your /FINAL FANTASY XI/ folder.
